# simple-api

The Simple API is a very simple Koa based API with a single endpoint `/` that returns `hello world` and logs the user-agent.

We would you like to deploy this API to AWS using which ever service you would like (provided the services has a free tier)

We would like changes to the application to be deployed automatically on merge to master

We would like to have a simple way of inspecting the application logs
